# MHS Golf Dayz League Rules

## Weekly Matchups & Drafts
- Each matchup features two owners drafting four golfers in a snake order (H–A–A–H–H–A–A–H).
- Drafts must finish before the lock deadline (23:59 local time the night before Round 1).
- After lock, picks freeze; the higher aggregate earnings wins the week.

## Usage Limits
- Golfers can be used a maximum of three times per season unless a Save Credit is applied.
- Drafting a prohibited golfer yields $0 and triggers an automatic field fallback to the highest-ranked eligible player.
- Fallback plays do not generate Save Credits.

## Saves
- Owners who roster the tournament winner receive one Save Credit.
- Saves can be applied prior to a draft to extend a golfer to a fourth usage.

## Escalation & Absent Owners
- If an opponent is unresponsive by lock day, escalate to the Commissioner with at least one hour remaining.
- If escalation fails, the present owner may submit four picks to the Commissioner and receives the win; the absent owner receives four field fallbacks and $0.

## Calcutta Events
- Majors and the John Deere Classic use a $100 budget auction.
- Owners may roster up to eight golfers per Calcutta event.
- Ties at $100 are resolved via a marble race animation.
- Absent owners receive auto-rosters equal to the rounded-up median roster size of present owners.

## Standings & Tiebreakers
- Standings track wins, losses, and season earnings.
- Division titles: best record; tiebreakers are head-to-head, division record, head-to-head earnings, season earnings.
- Wildcards: next best season earnings; tiebreakers are record, head-to-head, head-to-head earnings.

## Playoffs
- Seeds #1-#4: division winners seeded #1/#2 by record; remaining two seeds by earnings.
- Semifinals: #1 vs #4 and #2 vs #3 at the FedEx St. Jude Championship.
- Finals: BMW Championship with higher seed drafting first.
- Seed-based Save grants entering playoffs: #1→4, #2→3, #3→2, #4→1.

## Loser Punishment
- Post-season, the last-place owner (tiebreakers: lowest earnings, head-to-head record, earnings head-to-head) owes the champion a round of golf with drinks.
